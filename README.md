# Programming 2 (811322A) â€“ Spring 2025

This repository contains the major assignments for the **Programming 2** course (811322A-3013) at the University of Oulu, Spring 2025. The Programming 2 course is entirely completed in **Java**.

Take note that the contents within this repository are mostly taken from GitLab, and thus some CI-pipeline automation features as well as some of the automation related files might not be available. Each assignment has undergone automated CI testing and successfully passed the required tests, ensuring high code quality and thus there should be no major bugs present in the code. The code builds upon itself as it progresses through the exercises from 1 to 3, and thus some of the files in the newer updated files will be similar to the previous ones. Consider the files present in the '*homework3*' directory to be the finalized ones. 

## Structure
Each assignment is structured in its own directory with relevant source code and instructions. The directories named in the format of *homework'x'* where 'x' specifies the assignment order.
